# TODOS

## Connections

### Third-party rate-limit backoff in the broker

**What:** Per-connection rate-limit handling in the loopback broker: read the provider's `Retry-After` or rate-limit headers, back off, and queue instead of hammering.

**Why:** Gmail, Google Business Profile, Meta and QuickBooks all throttle. Today the broker passes the upstream status straight back to the calling agent with no retry (`src/main/integrationBroker.ts:264`, `:272`) behind a 30-second timeout, so a throttled provider reads to the agent as a failure and it retries blind, burning plan quota.

**Context:** Surfaced by the outside-voice pass during the 2026-09-15 engineering review of `docs/designs/business-mode-office-packs.md`. Decision 22 established a serialized executor with at most one in-flight execution per connection, and named that as the right home for backoff without deciding to build it. Decision 10's transient-versus-terminal retry classification covers approvals only, not ordinary agent calls. Start in the executor: classify 429 and 503 with `Retry-After`, hold the connection's queue, and surface a persistent throttle on the attention strip (Decision 25) rather than retrying silently forever.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** Decision 2 (per-agent grants), Decision 22 (serialized executor); only relevant from Phase 2, when agents make real third-party calls.

### A write to a connected app is never sent twice (issue #54)

**What:** The send once rule mail already has, for writes the broker forwards to a connected app (anything other than GET or HEAD): an identical write is recorded before it goes upstream and answered from that record if it comes again, across a restart too.

**Why:** The broker forwards a write with no dedupe behind a 30 second timeout (`src/main/integrationBroker.ts`, `UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT_MS`). If the provider accepts it but the answer is lost, or the app stops before it comes back, the agent's retry creates a second invoice, booking or contact. Plain mail sends got this in PR #126; connected app writes did not.

**Context:** Reuse PR #126's pattern inside the broker, not a new store: an app private journal like `mail-send-journal.json`, keyed on the agent, integration, method, path and a hash of the body, written as pending before the upstream call and settled after. Pass the key upstream where the provider takes one (an `Idempotency-Key` header, QuickBooks `requestid`). A write left pending after a stop that the app cannot check is refused with a plain reason telling the agent to tell Michael, as PR #126 does for mail; the app never makes or moves a card for it (Michael owns every card). Issue #54 also proposed a per task work record for engine hand off and proof of done; those stay with "Plan-limit handling", "Make a second engine (Codex first) ready for an office", #36, #48 and #51.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** None

### Message when the OS cannot encrypt stored credentials

**What:** A plain-language path for when Electron's `safeStorage` reports encryption unavailable, so connecting an account fails visibly instead of silently.

**Why:** The secret store refuses to write without OS encryption — "a secret is never written unless `safeStorage.isEncryptionAvailable()`" (`src/main/integrations.ts:12`, enforced at `:111`). That is the correct security behavior, but no screen explains it. On Linux without a keyring, or a Mac with a damaged keychain, the owner clicks Connect and nothing happens.

**Context:** Surfaced by the outside-voice pass during the 2026-09-15 engineering review. The onboarding failure table in the design doc covers cancelled sign-ins, wrong accounts, denied scopes and expired tokens, but not this one. Cheapest fix: check availability before opening the sign-in window in the Connector Center, say what is wrong and what to do, and gate any credential write on the same check. One test for the unavailable case.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** Decision 8 (product-owned connections) and the Connector Center screen; only bites once the product holds credentials itself, from Phase 2.

## Attachments (from the Codex adversarial review of design/studio-v2, 2026-10-01)

### Keep pasted screenshots somewhere durable

**What:** A pasted screenshot is saved to the OS temp folder (`clipboard:saveImage` in `src/main/index.ts`), and only that path goes into the message. Save it in an app folder tied to the message instead, and delete it once the message is delivered or removed, and on startup.

**Why:** A screenshot pasted into a busy team member's queue is persisted as a temp path. If the app quits or the Mac restarts before delivery, the restored queue can send a path that no longer exists, and every pasted image stays in temp until the OS clears it.

**Context:** This predates the Studio redesign (the queue composer used it already); the redesign also lets Talk to Michael paste screenshots through `src/renderer/src/components/pasteAttachments.ts`, though those are sent at once.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** None

## Mailboxes (deferred from ship of feat/multi-mailbox, 2026-09-26)

### Keep each agent's mail pass out of other agents' reach

**What:** Move each agent's `md-mail.mcp.json` (it holds that agent's broker token) out of the shared hive folder, or block other agents from reading `<hive>/agents/<other>/md-mail.mcp.json`, and delete it when the agent's terminal closes.

**Why:** Sandboxed team agents cannot reach the broker, but Michael runs unsandboxed and could read a Can send agent's token and send from its mailbox. Found in the pre-landing security review (`src/main/index.ts`, the md-mail block before `ptyManager.spawn`).

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P1

### Say "cannot check email" beside a schedule

**What:** When a schedule's agent has email off, show a short note on that schedule ("Pam cannot check email") in the On a schedule section and the office schedule.

**Why:** Plan CEO Section 4. A mail check schedule on an agent without email is silently ignored.

**Context:** Deferred from plan: docs/designs/multi-mailbox.md

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P1

### A build switch for the mailbox feature

**What:** A `buildFeatures.ts` flag that hides Mailboxes and the Email section, with the hook falling back to the Claude account switch alone when off.

**Why:** Plan Section 9 rollout.

**Context:** Deferred from plan: docs/designs/multi-mailbox.md

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P1

### Read one email without downloading its attachments

**What:** `MailService.read` fetches the whole message, attachments included, before trimming the text to 50K. Fetch the body structure plus the text part only, and take attachment names and sizes from the structure.

**Why:** A 25 MB message is held in memory in the main process for one read.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P2

### Page a search without searching again

**What:** Each search page re-runs the full IMAP SEARCH (ALL with no filters) and sorts every UID. Cache the UID list per mailbox and query for a short time, or default an unfiltered search to a recent window.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2

## Mail approvals and Michael replies (deferred from ship of feat/mail-approvals-michael-replies, 2026-10-07)

### Keep the approvals file in memory

**What:** Load mail-proposals.json once, keep it in memory, write through with an atomic rename, and read again only when its time stamp changes.

**Why:** Every approval call reads and parses the whole file several times, and it now also holds up to 500 send records per Send only member.

**Context:** Deferred by the owner (ship D5). `src/main/mailApprovals.ts` `load`/`save`; fire `changed()` only when proposals or standing approvals change.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** None

### Rebuild Michael's owner requests from open items only

**What:** Bound the 8 second rebuild of Michael's owner requests to messages newer than the oldest open item, and keep message bodies out of the never evicted cache.

**Why:** Since the fixed floor replaced the 30 day window, the work and the cached bodies grow with all conversation history.

**Context:** Deferred by the owner (ship D5). `src/main/hive.ts` `refreshOwnerRequests` and `ownerMessages`.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** None

### Authenticate hook events and keep the owner's messages out of the agents' folder

**What:** Give each spawned agent a secret for its hook events and ignore events whose agent id doesn't match, and move the owner's sent messages and dock state (agents/human) out of the hive folder agents can write. The design from issue #61: at spawn, main mints a random token per agent and keeps the token to agent map in memory only, never in the hive folder; each bridge carries it the way it already gets per agent config (the agent's `--settings` hook command, the hooks shim's env or config, the proxy sidecar's env); `HookServer` takes the agent from the token, not from the frame's `agent_id`, drops and logs a frame with a missing, unknown or mismatched token, and honours a `subagent_id` only under its parent's token; the token changes on every respawn and restart.

**Why:** Security reviews: an agent can send a fake Stop or SessionStart event naming Michael (his notes fallback now reads only his session start transcript inside Claude's folder, but another agent's own transcript is there too), and agents can write into agents/human.

**Context:** Owner decision D4 in the ship took the two cheap checks and left this with the existing data folder task. Start in `src/main/hooks.ts` (the hook socket, which reads the agent from the frame today) and `src/main/hive.ts` (`ownerSentDir`, `ownerStatePath`). A forged frame can overwrite another agent's saved session id (so it resumes the wrong conversation), add cost rows for it, or fire its Stop. One test per bridge kind (Claude settings hook, hooks shim, proxy sidecar) sends a frame naming another agent, and one with no token, and passes only when both are dropped. Every engine bridge posts to the same socket, so this is a gate for a second engine (gap 10 under "Make a second engine (Codex first) ready for an office").

## Update notices (deferred from ship of feat/claude-code-update-notice, 2026-09-30)

### Translate the update surfaces

**What:** Move the Claude Code update toast and chip (`CliUpdateNotice.tsx`), the app-update toast and badge, and the quit dialog's closing-time wording into en/zh-CN/ar.

**Why:** All of them are English only today, while most screens are translated; owner chose to translate them together rather than one notice at a time.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P3

### Say "closing" in dev builds when reopen is skipped

**What:** In dev (`ELECTRON_RENDERER_URL` set) the app quits instead of relaunching, but the dialog still says "reopening".

**Why:** Cosmetic, dev only; the event could carry whether a relaunch will really happen.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P4

## Secret store (deferred from ship of fix/atomic-secret-store, 2026-09-30)

### Say when deleting a secret did nothing

**What:** `deleteSecret` stays lenient on an unreadable file (right for callers without error handling), but callers report success while the old ciphertext stays.

**Why:** A removed mailbox or key can look deleted while its encrypted secret remains in the file.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3

## QuickBooks through the Claude account (deferred from ship of feat/qbo-claude-channel, 2026-09-30)

### Stop a nested Claude from reaching the account's connectors

**What:** Keep agents from starting their own `claude` (for example `claude -p`) outside the app's hooks, or turn off the Claude account's connectors for such runs.

**Update 2026-10-02 (docs/designs/claude-connectors.md):** once that plan ships, an agent with no connector grants starts with `ENABLE_CLAUDEAI_MCP_SERVERS=false`, which a nested `claude` inherits, so this is closed for them. It stays open for agents with at least one grant (explicit or the QuickBooks role default): a nested `claude` loads every connector with no deny rules. Options: a separate Claude config folder per agent, or blocking `claude` in agent shells.

**Why:** The QuickBooks switch and Capabilities are enforced by the app's PreToolUse hook, which reaches an agent only through `--settings` (`src/main/hive.ts`). A nested Claude started from Bash has no hook but inherits the account's QuickBooks (and email), so the switch off is not a hard guarantee. Stated in CHANGELOG 0.0.11.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P1

### Base the QuickBooks default on the role, not the agent id

**What:** Give hired agents with a books role the on + Read only default.

**Why:** Only an agent whose id is literally `oscar` gets it (`booksReadRoleIds` in `src/main/index.ts`); a bookkeeper hired later starts off.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3

### Say "couldn't reach QuickBooks" when the connector failed

**What:** Show a separate message for `✘ Failed to connect` instead of "needs you to sign in again".

**Why:** A network or server failure tells the owner to sign in.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3

### Status check side effects

**What:** Stop child MCP servers `claude mcp list` starts when the 30 s timeout kills it; avoid overlapping runs.

**Why:** The check starts every configured MCP server; a timeout can leave them running.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3

### Show a locally added QuickBooks server in the status

**What:** Read non-`claude.ai` QuickBooks servers from `claude mcp list` too.

**Why:** A QuickBooks server added with `claude mcp add` is gated but Settings says it is not connected.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3

### Validate the agent id when saving QuickBooks access

**What:** Refuse ids that are not on the roster in `quickbooks:setAccess`.

**Why:** Any string is written into `agentCapabilities` and would apply to a future agent with that id.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P4

## Closing time (deferred from ship of feat/closing-time-progress, 2026-09-29)

### Feed each row's latest line from the agent's transcript

**What:** Show the last thing each agent said under its row, read from its Claude transcript.

**Why:** The row's "latest line" was removed before release because `recentAssistantText` is only set by `src/renderer/src/mocks/mockEvents.ts`; real agents never fill it. The owner asked for it to tell a long process from a stuck one.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P2

### Rows in a second window

**What:** Give the closing-time rows names and detail in every window, not only the one that saw the hook events.

**Why:** Detail lives in the renderer store of the window that received `hive:hookEvent`; another window shows names but no detail.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3

### An agent respawned mid-close

**What:** Decide what happens to a row when an agent's terminal restarts while closing time runs.

**Why:** A respawned worker becomes live again and is waited on, but its row and Michael's "terminal ended" note may already be gone.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3

### Row still names a finished tool

**What:** After PostToolUse the row falls back to the action caption ("using Bash") and keeps counting minutes.

**Why:** The owner can read a finished step as still running.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3

### A refused tool call still shows its detail

**What:** PreToolUse that the hook denies (paused or gated) still sends `detail`.

**Why:** The row names a step that never ran.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3

### Parallel tool calls clear each other's detail

**What:** Track detail per tool call so one call's PostToolUse does not clear another's.

**Why:** With parallel calls, the row goes blank while a call is still running.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3

### Tests for the focus fallback and a post-tool row

**What:** Add tests for the listRef focus fallback and a describeRow case after PostToolUse; fix the stale `actionAt` docstring.

**Why:** Both paths are untested.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3

### Replace the source-regex dialog tests with pure helpers

**What:** Move the checks in `test/closing-time-dialog.test.cjs` that grep component source into tested helpers.

**Why:** They break on harmless edits (comments, added props) and passed review cycles several times only after loosening.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P3

### Archiving a live agent during closing time

**What:** Archiving through voice or `hive:setArchived` drops the agent from the wait list but does not call `closingTime.refresh` or tell Michael.

**Why:** Michael can keep waiting for an ACK that never comes until the 6-minute timeout.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3

### Mark the detail line as the agent's own words

**What:** The detail is agent-written text shown where the owner decides to close without someone.

**Why:** An agent can write "safe to close without me"; the owner's choice is steered by untrusted text.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3

### Limit combining marks in the detail line

**What:** Collapse long runs of combining marks, or clip the line's overflow.

**Why:** A line of stacked marks can draw over the neighbouring rows' buttons (visual only).

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3

## Schedules

### Starter jobs in an agent's empty Schedules tab

**What:** Show up to three suggested jobs from the office pack's `starterMissions` in an agent's empty Schedules tab, each added paused with one click (design decision 5A in `docs/designs/per-agent-schedules.md`).

**Why:** An empty tab is where an owner first learns an agent can run jobs on its own. A suggestion turns that into one click instead of inventing a job.

**Context:** Deferred while building per-agent schedules (2026-09-25) because no shipped pack in `resources/packs/` has `starterMissions`, and its `schedule` field is a free string with no defined format (`src/shared/officePack.ts:76`). The empty tab ships with its copy and add button. To build: define the schedule format (reuse `parseWhen` in `src/shared/missions.ts`), write starters into the packs, map pack agent ids to hive agent ids, and add the suggestion rows.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** starter jobs written into the shipped packs.

### Michael turns repeated work into a routine (issue #41)

**What:** When the same kind of work keeps getting done (for example chasing overdue invoices three weeks running), Michael sets it up as a scheduled job for the team member who does it, with its how in that member's Work style.

**Why:** Owners rarely notice which work repeats, so it stays manual. Starter jobs only cover what a business type usually needs, not how this office actually works.

**Context:** The app works out the repeats and Michael decides, so the duty never lives only in his prompt (card-lifecycle rule): group done cards that look like the same job (title, assignee, what was done) and keep each group in front of Michael until he acts or passes. Approval follows the office management rule (owner, 2026-10-10, issue #41): Michael sets up routine jobs himself through the schedule path and adds the how to the Work style; a job that touches money, customers, legal or security goes to Ask me first with the proposed job filled in. Nothing starts without one of those two.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** nothing.

## Agents and 1:1

### Show the rewritten instructions before saving a work style

**What:** When the owner edits a plain work style (hire or Edit Agent), show the instructions the app wrote from it and let them accept or undo, instead of saving straight away.

**Why:** The owner edits a summary; details the summary left out could still be lost in a rewrite. The prompt now keeps them, but the owner can't see the result.

**Context:** From the /ship pre-landing review of feat/hire-wizard (2026-09-27). `src/main/workStyleConvert.ts`, `toInstructionsPrompt` in `src/shared/workStyleText.ts`, AddAgentModal and EditAgentModal save paths.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** nothing.

### End a hidden Claude call early when it can't answer

**What:** A hidden call whose session is stuck on a trust or sign-in screen now waits for its full timeout (60 to 180 seconds). Detect a known blocking screen, or no transcript at all, and give up early so the rules fallback answers quickly.

**Why:** The owner waits on "checking..." for a minute when Claude is signed out.

**Context:** From the /ship pre-landing review (2026-09-27): `captureAndFinish` in `src/main/hiddenClaude.ts` re-arms until its own answer appears.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** nothing.

### Test Michael deciding schedule requests end to end

**What:** Runtime tests for `receiveScheduleRequest`, `michaelDecides`, `decideScheduleRequest` and `sweepScheduleRequests` in `src/main/index.ts` (unknown id, stale, escalated, pending list, the 12 hour escalation), which today are checked by source patterns only.

**Why:** These decide whether a request reaches Michael or the owner at all.

**Context:** From the /ship coverage audit (2026-09-27). Needs the functions moved into a module that tests can load with fake config and hive.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** nothing.

### Hire through Michael

**What:** The owner tells Michael "hire another admin for catering" and Michael asks the app to open the hire wizard on Review, prefilled with a job he adjusted. The owner still presses Hire; Michael can never hire on his own.

**Why:** The owner runs the office by talking to Michael, so hiring from chat fits how the app is used.

**Context:** Deferred in /plan-ceo-review of the hire wizard redesign (2026-09-27, D5.5) because it needs the wizard first (`docs/designs/hire-redesign.md`). To build: a Michael to app message (an MCP tool, since sandboxed Bash cannot reach the app), a prefill path into the Review step that runs the same distinct job check, and a guard that no agent message can press Hire.

**Effort:** L
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** the hire wizard redesign.


### One rule for "stuck at a prompt" in main and the panel

**What:** Put the terminal prompt check (`isTerminalPrompt` in `src/main/hooks.ts`) in shared code
and use it in the renderer's status parsing (`src/renderer/src/hooks/useHive.ts`), passing
`notification_type` through the hook event.

**Why:** Michael is told an agent is stuck from the prompt's type; the panel decides from words
in the message. For a dialog without those words, Michael hears "stuck" while the panel shows the
agent idle, with no coral bar and Talk 1:1 not leading. Found by the red team in the pre-landing
review of feat/per-agent-schedules (2026-09-25); the owner chose a follow-up.

**Priority:** P2

### Block mouse and focus reports in a watch-only terminal

**What:** While a team member's terminal is locked (outside 1:1), drop mouse report and focus
report sequences in `term.onData` (`src/renderer/src/components/terminalPool.ts`), letting the
terminal's own query replies through.

**Why:** The lock covers keys, paste, drop and composition. If the agent's program turns on mouse
tracking, a click in the watch-only terminal still reaches it. Low confidence in the pre-landing
review (2026-09-25); needs a check with a mouse-aware prompt.

**Priority:** P3

### Label messages with no usable date

**What:** In the Messages tab, give conversations whose messages have no valid `created_at` a
heading ("Undated") instead of an empty one (`src/shared/messageView.ts` localDay returns '').

**Why:** Only malformed files hit it, but the section then has no heading. Found by the local
model review (2026-09-25).

**Priority:** P4

## Business mode (deferred from plan, v0.0.1 ship)

Deferred from plan: `docs/designs/business-mode-office-packs.md` (owner chose "ship, defer as P1 TODOs" on 2026-09-24).

### Enforcement compiler and the default-deny hook

**What:** Compile each agent's levels into real permissions: `dontAsk`, compiled allow/deny rules, a default-deny PreToolUse hook (Decision 4, tests T2/T3).

**Why:** Today only the prompt layer (`teamMemberGoal`) limits agents, `bypassPermissions` is still the default, and the hook fails open. "Asks before sending" is instructed, not enforced.

**Context:** `src/shared/agentDefinition.ts` already carries levels and outward capabilities; `src/main/harnessGuard.ts` shows the PreToolUse pattern. Start by compiling one agent's levels into its per-session settings.

**Effort:** L
**Priority:** P1
**Depends on:** None

### Approvals inbox (with the two-zone panel and draft-to-post flow)

**What:** Approval action payloads, an executor, and the approvals UI (Decisions 31 and Ryan's "copy to clipboard and mark posted").

**Why:** Outward actions (emails, posts, spending) need a place for the owner to say yes; Ask me covers questions only.

**Context:** Ask me is the first tab on Michael's panel now; approvals likely sit beside it.

**Effort:** XL
**Priority:** P1
**Depends on:** Enforcement compiler

### Office schedule (officeHours)

**What:** Honour each pack's `officeHours`: soft pause outside hours, office state, wired to `weeklySchedule`.

**Why:** Validated in the pack schema but never used, so the office runs around the clock regardless.

**Context:** `src/shared/officePack.ts` (officeWindow), `src/shared/weeklySchedule.ts`.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P1
**Depends on:** None

### Plan-limit handling

**What:** Detect Claude usage limits (StopFailure `rate_limit`, quota hooks), show an office break state and a banner.

**Why:** On smaller Claude plans the office stops mid-day with no explanation; setup now tells owners a Max plan is needed, but nothing handles hitting the limit.

**Context:** Hooks arrive in `src/main/hooks.ts`.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P1
**Depends on:** Attention strip

### Attention strip and owner floor layout (Decisions 25, 27)

**What:** The minimal attention strip, plain-language agent cards, approvals in the right panel.

**Why:** Owners need one place that says what needs them now.

**Context:** The floor now has OFFICE, TASKS and GRAPH views and a blocked-count badge; the strip is the next layer.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P1
**Depends on:** None

### Close dialog and tray (Decisions 1, 39)

**What:** A close dialog with a safe default and keyboard contract, and a tray so the office keeps running.

**Why:** Closing the window ends the day for the whole office; there is no way to keep it running in the background.

**Context:** Since the Studio redesign, closing the main window with terminals running starts closing time on the floor (`ClosingTimeBar`, via `app:closeRequested` in `src/main/index.ts`), the same as quitting. What is left is the tray, and a choice between closing the window and quitting.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P1
**Depends on:** None

### Per-agent levels screen (Decision 33)

**What:** A screen per agent in the order job, limits, connect.

**Why:** Autonomy is one global checkbox; owners cannot give Oscar less freedom than Pam.

**Context:** Pairs with the enforcement compiler.

**Effort:** L
**Priority:** P1
**Depends on:** Enforcement compiler

### First-success confirmation and morning report (Decision 32)

**What:** Confirm the first finished job to the owner, and a morning summary, plus a weekly digest for owners who open the app once a week (issue #81): emails handled and drafted, tasks closed by each team member, scheduled jobs run, and what still waits on the owner.

**Why:** New owners need proof the office works while they were away.

**Context:** Packs declare `firstAction` (Decision 29), used only in agent goals today. Every count comes from what the app recorded (the task ledger, the mail send records, the schedule runs), never from Michael's memory, and a week with nothing in it says so plainly. Deliver it the way reports already work: Michael posts it on Ask me as a report (`kind: "report"`), from a schedule the owner can see and change in Schedules. No estimated time saved: the owner declined it (2026-10-10, #81), because minutes per task set by the owner would end up wrong for everyone.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P1
**Depends on:** None

### Owner floor narrow layout (Decision 38)

**What:** A layout for narrow windows.

**Why:** The floor and side panel crowd each other on small laptop screens.

**Context:** `src/renderer/src/App.tsx` floor area and SidebarSplitter.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P1
**Depends on:** None

### 14px text floor on the remaining setup screens (Decision 36)

**What:** Raise the business and team setup screens' 10 to 13px text to 14px or more.

**Why:** The owner's standing rule; the surfaces added later in the branch were already fixed.

**Context:** `src/renderer/src/components/OnboardingWizard.tsx` (business, team steps; TeamCard, PackTile).

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P1
**Depends on:** None

## Documents and security (review items skipped for v0.0.1)

### Parse documents off the main thread

**What:** Run PDF and OOXML extraction in a worker thread or utility process, with a time and page limit.

**Why:** Large or crafted files block every window while they parse.

**Context:** `src/main/docText.ts`; `docTextCli.ts` already runs the same code as a separate entry.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** None

## Schedules

### Make the heartbeat's description honest

**What:** The heartbeat card in Schedules shows an editable description box, but the heartbeat never sends that text. It sends a summary it builds itself (`buildHeartbeatDigest`, `src/main/index.ts`). Either show the heartbeat's description as fixed text, or send the owner's text ahead of the summary.

**Why:** An owner who edits the box expects Michael to receive it. Every other schedule stopped carrying a prompt on 2026-09-25 (the label names the job and the agent's Work style says how), so the heartbeat is the one card left with a box, and it's a box that does nothing.

**Context:** Found in the 2026-09-25 agent instructions audit; the owner chose to leave the heartbeat as it is for now (it ships off). `src/renderer/src/components/triggers/ScheduleList.tsx` keeps the box for `kind: 'heartbeat'` only.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** nothing.

## Engines

### Make a second engine (Codex first) ready for an office

**What:** Close the gaps that keep engines other than Claude Code out of `BUILD_ENGINES`, starting with Codex, then add it to the list.

**Why:** An audit on 2026-09-24 found that the code for Codex, Gemini CLI and Antigravity exists, but none is ready for an office without Claude. Only Codex has live history (hooks, idle, messaging and resume were debugged on real workers). Every picker and voice hiring now offer only `BUILD_ENGINES`, so nothing half-working can be chosen until this is done.

**Context:** In order of impact:
1. ~~The team always starts on the default engine.~~ Done 2026-09-26: setup now writes `defaultCommand` from Michael's engine (`teamDefaultsFromMichael`, `test/team-engine-from-michael.test.cjs`).
2. Cost and token data: Codex is done. The telemetry fallback reads a Codex agent's rollout in its CODEX_HOME (`src/main/codexUsage.ts`, `hive.codexHome`), and `src/main/pricing.ts` prices GPT-5 models. Still open: Gemini and the other engines (no usage source yet), the context gauge for Codex (`readContextTokens` reads only the default engine's transcripts), and the lifetime cost ledger, which only records live OTel samples. For Gemini, issue #113 has the plan: read the session `.jsonl` at the hook payload's `transcript_path` (already kept as `hookServer.transcriptPath(id)`), skip `$set` and `$rewindTo` lines, keep the last copy of each message id (late token updates re-append it), keep rewound turns (they were billed), map `cacheRead = cached`, `input = input - cached + tool`, `output = output + thoughts`; fall back to the project slug in `~/.gemini/projects.json` when no hook has fired; add Gemini Pro and Flash rows to `pricing.ts`; prove it live with one Gemini worker under a low token cap.
3. MCP servers go only into Claude's `--settings` (`src/main/hive.ts:1163`). Codex now gets bundled skills in its private `CODEX_HOME/skills`; other engines still need native skill discovery. The md-mail server is the same gap (issue #109): `index.ts` writes it and passes `--mcp-config` only for Claude, so a Codex member with email starts with no mail tools. Fix: write an `[mcp_servers.md-mail]` entry in the agent's private `CODEX_HOME/config.toml` (same command, args and env, a fresh broker token each spawn), removed at teardown like the Claude file. The mail gate in `hooks.ts` matches only Claude's `mcp__md-mail__` tool names, so the same change makes it match Codex's names too: a mail tool on any engine passes the same check, and a test proves a Codex mail call is gated.
4. Gemini and Antigravity get no extra writable directories (`--add-dir` exists for Codex only, `src/main/hive.ts:859`), so hive file writes may be refused.
5. Antigravity agents never get their standing goal, and an Antigravity Michael never gets the roster (no SessionStart/UserPromptSubmit event).
6. The app's own background calls run only on Claude (issue #85): memory tidy up (`src/main/memoryTidy.ts`), the standing approval check (`standingCheck.ts`), the hire check (`hireCheck.ts`) and the three Work style helpers (`workStyleConvert.ts`) all pass `defaultCommand` to `runHiddenClaude`, which builds Claude arguments. On a Codex office each fails; the worst is the standing approval check, so every email under a standing approval falls back to Ask me. Fix: a `runHiddenModel({ engine, tier, prompt, noTools, cwd, timeoutMs })` with one runner per engine, the engine taken from Michael's preset, not the command string. Claude keeps the current path. Codex runs `codex exec --ephemeral --ignore-user-config --skip-git-repo-check -s read-only -C <empty dir> --disable shell_tool --disable unified_exec --disable apps --disable browser_use --disable computer_use -c web_search=disabled -o <answer file>` (tested in #85 with codex-cli 0.162.1: two standing checks judged right, a prompt asking for a shell command refused). An engine with no runner returns unavailable at once and the caller uses its existing fallback. Callers that read text written by agents or outside senders (the standing check, the memory tidy up) keep `noTools: true` and a runner serves them only with every tool off. Tests: each caller with a fake runner, answered and unavailable, and one that a Codex office never runs `codex` with Claude arguments.
7. Michael's first prompt is still written for one engine (`INITIAL_GOD_PROMPT` in `src/renderer/src/hooks/useHive.ts:77`). The spawn prompt and PROTOCOL.md now say "AI agents".
8. No permission-prompt detection for these engines (no Notification event), which matters only with auto mode off.
9. The access policy reaches Claude only (issue #48). Folder privacy (`denyRead`/`denyWrite`), connector deny and the MCP list are written into Claude's `--settings` (`hookSettings` in `src/main/hive.ts`); Codex gets its own workspace sandbox and `--add-dir`, but no folder read privacy or connector deny. Before any engine joins `BUILD_ENGINES`: build the one policy into each engine's own settings, record per engine which rules it can enforce, and where it can't, limit that agent (mail Draft only, connectors off) with the reason on its Access tab. A test per engine tries a read of another member's folder, a write outside its own and a denied connector, and passes only when each is blocked or the agent is limited. `test/engine-readiness.test.cjs` checks the preset half today.
10. Hook events are not authenticated (issue #61): every engine's bridge posts to the one hook socket, which believes the agent named in the frame. The per agent token in "Authenticate hook events and keep the owner's messages out of the agents' folder" lands first, and the new engine's bridge passes its forged frame test.
11. No test of a run on each engine (issue #83). With a fake CLI process standing in for the engine (no paid calls), one shared test per engine checks: it starts and finishes a task, reports completion, and handles a sign-in failure, a plan or quota limit, a cancel and its cleanup, each with a plain reason to the owner. It runs in CI on every platform the engine ships for, beside `test/office-privacy-conformance.test.cjs` and `test/engine-readiness.test.cjs`.

A live end-to-end run is required before adding an engine: Gemini has never been run for real, and Codex needs an OpenAI account with credits.

**Effort:** L
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** A decision to offer a second engine.

## Onboarding

### Retry team members that failed their first start

**What:** Mark `businessTeamStarted` only once every picked member is running; tell the owner who did not start.

**Why:** A member that fails at first launch is never retried and the owner is not told. Owner chose to leave it at ship review 2026-09-24.

**Context:** `startBusinessTeam` in `src/renderer/src/hooks/useHive.ts`.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** None

## Settings

### Log the webhook format editor's parse error

**What:** `console.error` the raw JSON parse message in `src/renderer/src/components/triggers/WebhookSchemaEditor.tsx`, and make `error` a boolean.

**Why:** The owner now sees plain words, but nobody can see where the mistake was.

**Context:** Third review pass, 2026-09-24.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** None

## Release

### Sign and notarize the Mac build with an Apple Developer ID

**What:** Add the Developer ID Application cert and notarization credentials as repo secrets (`APPLE_CERTIFICATE_P12`, `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`). `release.yml` and `build/notarize.cjs` already use them when present.

**Why:** 0.0.1 ships ad-hoc signed. Owners must clear a "could not verify" dialog through Privacy & Security on first open, and Squirrel.Mac cannot update an ad-hoc app in place, so every update falls back to "download the new version" instead of restart to install. macOS also forgets folder grants between versions without a stable signature.

**Context:** Needs an Apple Developer Program membership (paid, per organization). Once the secrets exist, the ad-hoc fallback in `release.yml` switches off by itself; update RELEASE.md's install steps then.

**Effort:** S (after the Apple account exists)
**Priority:** P1
**Depends on:** Apple Developer Program membership

## Repo

### Remove or rewrite the old project's website files in docs/

**What:** What is left of the old project's website: `docs/blog/` with its source in `blog/`, `docs/sitemap.xml`, `.github/workflows/blog.yml`, and the upstream promo media that was in `docs/media/` (removed on 2026-10-01 with the v2 redesign). (The site pages, `docs/CNAME`, `robots.txt`, the Google verification file, the research, drops, hires gallery, evidence and deck were removed on 2026-09-28. `docs/llms.txt` and `docs/llms-full.txt` went in the 0.0.1 land: GitHub Pages is off for this repo, so nothing served them.)

**Why:** They describe the other product.

**Context:** The website for this app lives in its own repo; keep only files the app reads at runtime (`docs/model-catalog.json`, `docs/hero.json`).

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** None

### Record demo videos of Don't Be Michael

**What:** New demo videos of this app: a short hero clip for the top of the README, and an agents-at-work clip with a poster image for the README's "Watch the office work" section, which now shows a still.

**Why:** The README shows stills only. The old project's recordings (`docs/media/hero.mp4`, `docs/media/demo/agents.mp4`) were removed on 2026-10-01 with the v2 redesign, since they showed the Munder Difflin pixel UI.

**Context:** The studio lab (`npm run lab`, `docs/demo/studio-lab.html?clean&autoplay`) plays the office on a neutral example office and is made for recording. Keep files small (under 5 MB), commit an mp4 plus a jpg poster under `docs/media/`, and point the README at them. Delete whatever of `landing-remotion/` is no longer used. The website repo may want the same clips.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** None

## Completed

### Cap the total size of an Office file's zip entries

**What:** In `src/main/docText.ts` (unzip filter, ~line 108) cap total uncompressed bytes and entry count, not only each entry.

**Why:** A crafted .docx/.xlsx/.pptx can declare many large entries and exhaust memory in the main process, taking every agent down. Owner skipped this at ship review 2026-09-24.

**Context:** Count accepted entries and sum `originalSize` in the filter; reject past e.g. 200 MB / 5,000 entries.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P1
**Depends on:** None
**Completed:** 0.1.7 (2026-10-09). Before inflating anything, `fromOoxml` adds up the declared sizes of the XML parts it would read and refuses the file past 200 MB or 5,000 parts; media still never counts (agentvivekkumar/dontbemichael#58).

### Decide the Git for Windows check

**What:** On the clean PC, install Claude Code and start one session. If it needs Git Bash, add a Git for Windows check to onboarding (E3).

**Why:** If Git Bash is missing, a Windows beta user would get stuck at their first agent start.

**Context:** E3 in `docs/designs/windows-11-installer.md` depends on that smoke test, which has not run yet.

**Effort:** human S / CC S
**Priority:** P1
**Depends on / blocked by:** the PC smoke test.
**Completed:** 0.1.6 (2026-10-09). A Windows office without Git for Windows runs Claude Code, which then runs hooks in PowerShell; the app now writes hooks for that shell (`src/main/hookShell.ts`), so no Git for Windows step is needed in onboarding.

### Clean up a "Not for" clause when its teammate leaves

**What:** When a hire is bound to a mailbox or topic, overlapping teammates' routing lines gain "Not for <scope>; that goes to <Name>." If that teammate is later renamed or removed, rewrite or drop the clause.

**Why:** A stale clause sends Michael to a name that no longer exists, and the work bounces.

**Context:** Found by the spec review of the hire wizard redesign (2026-09-27). The clause format is `bindingLines` in `src/shared/hireTemplates.ts`; hook the rename path in `hive.ts` and agent removal in the renderer.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2
**Completed:** 0.1.0 (2026-10-04). A rename rewrites the clause on every teammate (renamePatches); closing or forgetting the hire takes it off and keeps it on the hire, and it goes back when they return (src/renderer/src/shell/releaseBindings.ts).

### Recognise the connector behind an opaque server name

**What:** When the connector's server has a UUID-like name, 16 of its tools (including `money_onboarding_application_submit`) are not recognised as QuickBooks and are not gated.

**Why:** Claude Code names claude.ai connectors `claude_ai_Intuit_QuickBooks`, which matches; a differently named server would not. Match on the connector URL from `claude mcp list` or on the full tool catalog.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2
**Completed:** 0.0.15 (2026-10-02). Any MCP server that is not a discovered, granted connector is now refused by default (docs/designs/claude-connectors.md), so an opaque name can no longer slip past.

### Subagents keep their parent's QuickBooks access

**What:** Tag hook payloads with the harness agent id so a subagent's own `agent_id` does not replace it.

**Why:** If Claude Code sends a subagent id, the hook finds no capability and refuses Oscar's delegated QuickBooks reads (fails closed).

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3
**Completed:** 0.0.15 (2026-10-02). The hook shim always sends the agent's own id and keeps Claude Code's subagent id as `subagent_id`, so delegated calls follow the agent's QuickBooks, connector and folder rules.

### Back the Claude account switch with more than the hook

**What:** The Your Claude account switch was enforced only by the PreToolUse hook, which let calls through when the hook could not reach the app, and matched connectors by server name.

**Completed:** 0.0.15 (2026-10-02). Replaced by per-connector grants (docs/designs/claude-connectors.md): connectors are kept out at spawn, the hook shim fails closed for MCP calls, and connectors are matched by tool name. Left open: local-scope and project `.mcp.json` servers are not in the start-up deny list (the hook still refuses them).

### Point the contributors workflow at this fork's credit, or turn it off

**What:** `.github/workflows/contributors.yml` regenerates CONTRIBUTORS.md from this repo's merged pull requests and opens a bot pull request.

**Why:** On this fork that list would drop the original project's contributors, which the README credits.

**Context:** Found in the 0.0.1 land audit. A bot pull request is harmless until someone merges it.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** None
**Completed:** 2026-09-24 (the workflow stays on; CONTRIBUTORS.md now lists this repo's contributors only, and the README no longer credits the upstream list there)

## Claude account connectors (deferred from /plan-ceo-review, 2026-10-02)

### Per-connector activity log

**What:** Record each connector call (agent, connector, tool, allowed or refused) and show recent use on each row of Settings > Connections > Claude connectors.

**Why:** Once connectors are granted per agent, the owner will ask what an agent did in HubSpot or Drive; refusals are otherwise visible only in the agent's own terminal.

**Pros:** A clear record of who touched which system; builds on the hook's refusal log lines from the connectors plan.

**Cons:** A new screen, log rotation and privacy wording.

**Context:** Deferred as E5 (D7) in docs/designs/claude-connectors.md. The hook already sees every MCP call (`src/main/hooks.ts`).

**Effort:** M (human) / S (CC)
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** the Claude connectors plan.

### Disable the owner's Claude Code plugins in agent sessions

**What:** Start agents with the owner's Claude Code plugins (skills, hooks, agent definitions) disabled, not only their MCP servers.

**Why:** E1 in docs/designs/claude-connectors.md blocks personal and plugin MCP servers, but plugin skills, hooks and agents still load in every agent session; a plugin hook runs code on agent events.

**Pros:** Closes the rest of the leak E1 targets; agents run only what the app provides.

**Cons:** Needs a probe of which flag or setting disables plugins for one session without touching the owner's own Claude Code.

**Context:** Seen 2026-10-02: plugins enterprise-search and finance load in agent sessions (stream-json `init`).

**Effort:** S (human) / S (CC)
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** nothing.

## Watch list (no issue seen yet; act only if the symptom shows up)

### Agents skip their folder or company knowledge

**Watch for:** an agent answers a policy, price or "how we do it" question from memory or the internet when the answer is in the company knowledge store; an agent asks the owner for a document already in its folder; this happens more late in a long session or after a compaction.

**How it works today:** agents are only told, never reminded. At spawn, `injectedPrompt` (`src/main/hive.ts`) puts the folder line ("read it for context before searching the internet"), `companyKnowledgeLine` ("when a task touches any of that, search it") and `memoryRule` into `--append-system-prompt`. At session start the hook (`src/main/hooks.ts`) adds the company profile, which ends with a pointer to the knowledge store, and the memory index. `knowledgeUpdate` speaks only when the owner turns the store on or off. Nothing repeats per task, nothing searches for the agent, nothing lists the folder's files, and nothing records whether `kg search` ran.

**Smaller gaps:** Michael's folder line does not say to read it for context; Michael's hand-off rules say "where to look" but never name company knowledge; Codex, Grok and agy get the text only as their first message.

**Fixes, strongest first:**
1. On a new task, have the hook run `kg search` on the task text and attach the top 2 or 3 matches (capped, skipped when nothing matches).
2. A one-line reminder through the hook when a new inbox task arrives.
3. A short list of the agent's folder files at session start, sent again when it changes (like the roster).
4. Log `kg` calls from activity events so agents that never search are visible. Do this first if the symptom appears, to confirm it.

**Context:** Investigated 2026-10-02 on the owner's question; owner chose to watch rather than build, since no issue has been seen.

**Effort:** S to M (human) / S (CC)
**Priority:** P3 (watch)
**Depends on:** nothing.

## Windows

### Sign the Windows installer

**What:** Choose a Windows signing service (Microsoft Trusted Signing, or a vendor cloud key such as DigiCert KeyLocker or SSL.com eSigner), then wire `release.yml` so the Windows leg signs when its secrets exist and builds unsigned, without failing, when they don't.

**Why:** Unsigned installers show "Windows protected your PC"; people must click More info, then Run anyway. Some small business owners stop there.

**Pros:** Removes or shortens the warning; the publisher name shows in the install prompt.

**Cons:** A paid account and a one-time identity check; a new signature can still warn until Windows' reputation system trusts it.

**Context:** Accepted as E1 in `docs/designs/windows-11-installer.md` (CEO review 2026-10-04), with wiring deferred by R5 until the owner picks a service at sign up. New certificates must keep their key in hardware or a cloud vault, so a certificate file in CI secrets is not an option. Mirror the Mac notarize step: absent secrets mean an unsigned build and no failure.

**Effort:** human M / CC S
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on / blocked by:** the owner choosing a service and passing its identity check.

### Copy diagnostics for problem reports

**What:** A "Copy diagnostics" button beside Settings' Report a problem: app and OS versions, the last 50 office event types from `log.jsonl`, agent exit summaries, with paths and names redacted; copied to the clipboard only.

**Why:** Report a problem carries version numbers only, on purpose, so beta reports can lack what happened just before the failure.

**Pros:** Remote debugging of Windows beta problems without back and forth.

**Cons:** Redaction must be exact: office names, folder paths and customer names must never reach the copy.

**Context:** Deferred as S3 in `docs/designs/windows-11-installer.md` (CEO review 2026-10-04) to design from what the first real beta reports lack. Sources: hive `log.jsonl`, `crashes/` (raw terminal tails, never copied raw).

**Effort:** human M / CC S
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on / blocked by:** the first Windows beta reports.

### Go live steps for the Windows beta

**What:** In order:
1. Push an rc tag (vX.Y.Z-rc.1).
2. ~~Read the first "Tests (Windows)" CI run and fix each POSIX-only test, or skip it on win32 with a reason.~~ Done 2026-10-09: tests are platform scoped (`test/platform.cjs`, CONTRIBUTING.md). Text files check out with LF (`.gitattributes`), Windows test path assumptions were made portable, and Mac or POSIX only tests skip on Windows with a reason.
3. Run the rc.1 and rc.2 checklist on the clean x64 Windows 11 PC: install through SmartScreen, onboard, hire, task, mail archive search, schedule, rc.1 updates to rc.2, a user name with a space and an accent, an office folder in OneDrive, and agent start time under Defender. Also check that rc.2 is offered the clean release.
4. ~~Once it is green, remove `continue-on-error: true` from the `test-windows` job~~ Done 2026-10-09 (ci.yml now also runs "Tests (macOS)", and every job blocks). Done 2026-10-10: Typecheck, Build, Tests (macOS) and Tests (Windows) are required checks on main in the "protect main" ruleset, and admins can bypass them only by merging a pull request.
5. ~~Set the repository variable `WINDOWS_RELEASE=on`.~~ Done 2026-10-05: the owner chose to ship Windows on every release before the PC check. v0.1.1 got its Windows installer added after release.
6. After the first clean release that carries Windows, add the Windows (beta) download to the website, and confirm with the owner before that push.

**Why:** Windows ships on every release before the PC check (owner, 2026-10-05); these steps confirm it works. The website push is a production deploy.

**Context:** Deferred from the ship of feat/windows-beta-askme-fixes (2026-10-05). These are post-merge steps from `docs/designs/windows-11-installer.md` (T5, T10, R9, R10, E5).

**Depends on / blocked by:** this branch merged; the physical PC.

## Ask me (deferred from ship of feat/windows-beta-askme-fixes, 2026-10-05)

### FEATURES.md entries at land

**What:** Add the Ask me file rows and the Windows beta to `docs/FEATURES.md` when this branch lands.

**Why:** FEATURES.md is updated at each land.

**Context:** Deferred from plan: `docs/designs/ask-me-open-file.md` and `docs/designs/windows-11-installer.md`.

**Effort:** human S / CC S
**Priority:** P1

### Match catch-up requests to their answer

**What:** The launch catch-up compares each answer with the card's newest owner request. If the request for one answer failed, and the owner then answered another question on the same card, the first answer is never sent. Match each request to its answer instead, by the answer key or answeredAt carried in the request.

**Context:** Re-review of this ship, P3. Rare: it needs a failed send plus a second answer on the same card before the next launch.

**Effort:** human S / CC S
**Priority:** P3

### Owner requests on cards Michael marked Done

**What:** A request on a Done card counts as open only when it came after the card's `closedAt`, and only owner closes set `closedAt`. If Michael marks a card Done in the ledger while a question is still open, the owner's answer to it is left out of his open requests list. It still reaches his inbox.

**Fix options:** Stamp a done time whenever a card enters Done. Or keep a request whose answer came after the card's last open question.

**Context:** Re-review of this ship, P2 at confidence 6. Michael's instructions already forbid closing a card that has an open question.

**Effort:** human S / CC S
**Priority:** P3

### Tell Michael when finishing by voice withdrew a question

**What:** A voice "done with a result" withdraws the card's open questions, but Michael gets no owner change note for it, unlike a close from Tasks.

**Effort:** human S / CC S
**Priority:** P3

### Answer only the question being answered

**What:** hive:patchTask accepts an answer on any open slot whose question text matches. Send the target index with the patch, and accept the answer only on that slot.

**Context:** Re-review of this ship, P3 at confidence 4. It needs Michael to clear an answer and ask the same text again within the 5 s snapshot.

**Effort:** human S / CC S
**Priority:** P4

### A React test harness

**What:** Add a small render harness (jsdom with react-dom) so these renderer paths get behavior tests instead of source regex pins:
- Ask me rows
- the per-index answer
- AskFileRows states
- Task detail withdrawn text
- the floor's flight rules

**Context:** The coverage audit for this ship found 7 paths that are only pinned by source regex (73% value-weighted). The same applies to the IPC handlers in `src/main/index.ts`, which tests cannot load.

**Effort:** human M / CC M
**Priority:** P2

### Trust boundaries Codex raised on Ask me (2026-10-05)

**What:** Codex adversarial pass 2 raised these items. Each one either already exists on main or needs a design decision:
1. **Question text in Michael's request.** The question is copied verbatim into Michael's `from: human` request, and an agent writes that question. Label it as card text and fold it to one line, or send only the card id plus the owner's answer.
2. **Who closed the question.** Open or closed is decided by whether a string is present, so a worker that writes tasks.json can set `a` or `dismissedAt` and hide a question. Give answers and withdrawals provenance: the recorded owner answer keys for answers, plus a trusted withdrawal marker.
3. ~~**The 30-day window.**~~ Done 2026-10-06 (michael-replies.md): a fixed floor replaces the rolling window.
4. ~~**Reply alias.**~~ Done 2026-10-06 (michael-replies.md): any name that reaches the owner closes a request.
5. **File swap race.** `fs:openAskFile` checks the file and then opens it by path. The swap window is milliseconds, because the check runs at click time. Open a verified copy or a file handle instead.

**Effort:** human M / CC S
**Priority:** P2

### Hire wizard offers Send only from an existing mailbox (deferred 2026-10-06)

- **What:** In the hire wizard's mailbox step, also list "Send only from <address> (<owner>)" for roles whose pack card sends mail.
- **Why:** A new sales hire could send outreach from the owner's address from day one instead of needing a second step on the Access tab.
- **Pros:** Teaches Send only where it matters; no extra trip to the Access tab.
- **Cons:** One more choice in an already full wizard step.
- **Context:** docs/designs/shared-mailboxes.md (E4, owner deferred in the CEO review). Send only grants live on the Access tab first.
- **Depends on / blocked by:** Send only grants (shared-mailboxes.md accepted scope) shipping first.
