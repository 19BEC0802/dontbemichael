/**
 * Who may open and change which folder in an office (owner, 2026-09-25).
 *
 *  - Every agent's folder is private: only that agent (and anyone sharing the
 *    folder, which agents in the same role do by default) and anyone above it
 *    can open it. Michael's folder is no exception: only he and the owner (who
 *    isn't an agent) open it.
 *  - Michael works in the business folder (`~/Documents/<Business>`), and every
 *    team member's folder sits inside it by default. He is the only boss today.
 *  - A boss can READ a team member's folder but not change it. To get a file
 *    into it, the boss asks the team member.
 *  - Company wide information, policies and rules are shared through the
 *    knowledge feature, which every agent searches; no folder is shared.
 *
 * One pure module feeds both layers that enforce this:
 *  - `folderPolicy` becomes the Claude Code settings for a spawn: the OS
 *    sandbox (which covers shell commands, even in auto mode, on a Mac and
 *    Linux; Claude Code has no sandbox on Windows, so shell commands are not
 *    limited there, owner 2026-10-09) plus permission deny rules (which cover
 *    Claude's own file tools on every platform).
 *  - `folderDecision` is asked by the PreToolUse hook on every file tool call,
 *    so it sees folders created after the agent started, and it covers Michael's
 *    own top-level files, which a static rule can't express without also hiding
 *    the folders inside it.
 *
 * Kept in one place so a later owner-defined sharing screen can replace the
 * rules without touching the plumbing.
