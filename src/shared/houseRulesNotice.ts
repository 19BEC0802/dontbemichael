/**
 * House rules reach a resumed conversation (owner, 2026-10-11).
 *
 * The rules ride in each agent's start instructions, but the app resumes every
 * agent's old conversation, and an agent follows its own recent example over a
 * quiet new line (seen live: Nick had rule 7 and still copied the Sources list
 * of the report he was asked to extend). So when the rules change, an agent
 * that resumes gets one inbox note quoting the new or reworded rules.
 *
 * Each rule is remembered by its wording, so rewording a rule counts as a
 * change. No electron / node imports: tests load it directly.
