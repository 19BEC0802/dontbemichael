/**
 * Environment construction for agent PTYs, as a pure function so the layering

 *
 * The layering rule, bottom to top:
 *   1. the inherited environment, minus the parent Claude session's identity
 *   2. the app's own defaults (PATH, terminal identity, locale)
 *   3. per-agent values (`opts.env`) — always win, even over the strip below

/**
 * The app is often launched from INSIDE a Claude Code session (`npm run dev`
 * typed into a claude terminal), so that session's identity markers arrive via
 * `process.env` and would flow into every agent CLI. CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION
 * makes the agent believe it is a child session and silently DISABLES
 * transcript saving ("Transcript saving is off — inherited
 * CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION marker"), which breaks --resume for every agent of
 * that run: their sessions never reach disk (bit us live 2026-08-16/17 — no
 * worker transcript ever existed). The session id, pid, messaging socket+token,
 * effort, execpath and entrypoint likewise all describe the PARENT session,
 * never a fresh agent.
 *
 * Stripped by PREFIX rather than by name: the CLI grows new markers faster
 * than a hardcoded list keeps up (a five-name list was already seven short of
 * a live session's dump when review caught it). Agents are top-level sessions
 * regardless of how the app was launched, so they inherit NONE of the parent's
 * Claude identity.
