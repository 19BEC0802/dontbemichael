 * app used to rebuild an EMPTY office at the old path, silently: the team came
 * back with no memory, tasks or history. Now a missing office skips that, and
 * the renderer shows the "we can't find your office" screen instead of the
 * floor. Every normal launch goes straight in, with no picker (owner,
 * 2026-09-24).
 *
 * Plain node:fs, no electron import, so it tests as a node module.
